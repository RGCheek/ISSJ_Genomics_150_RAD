## Data
### Genomic Data

Neutral and adaptive SNP VCFs also available on Dryad. doi:10.5061/dryad.8sf7m0cpq
ISSJ.ZF.ordered_imputed_BEAGLE -- conveniently in different formats for scripts to run

ISSJ.ZF.ordered_imputed_BEAGLE_neutral -- For PCA 

radiator_data_neutral --For mantel and neutral popstats since you don't need complete data for these to run


### Phenotype & Environment data 

ISSJ_resistance_data.csv -- For MLPE

issj_filtered.csv -- Individuals that were filtered due to missing data. Need this to filter the environmental data 

ISSJ_individual_data.csv -- Phenotype data 

ISSJ_environmental_data_final.csv -- For RDA
